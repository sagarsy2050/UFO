# About Dataset
# Context
Extraterrestrials, visitors, little green men, UFOs, swap gas. What do they want? Where do they come from? Do they like cheeseburgers? This dataset will likely not help you answer these questions. It does contain over 80,000 records of UFO sightings dating back as far as 1949. With the latitude and longitude data it is possible to assess the global distribution of UFO sightings (patterns could aid in planetary defence if invasion proves to be imminent). The dates and times, along with the duration of the UFO's stay and description of the craft also lend themselves to predictions. Can we find patterns in their arrival times and durations? Do aliens work on weekends? Help defend the planet and learn about your fellow earthlings (and when they are most likely to see ET).

Note there are missing data in the columns. I've left it as is because depending on what the user is interested in the missing values in any one column may or may not matter.
